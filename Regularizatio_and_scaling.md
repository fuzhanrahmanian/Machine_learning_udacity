# Description 


- In this assignment's data.csv, find data for a bunch of points including six predictor variables and one outcome variable. Use sklearn's Lasso class to fit a linear regression model to the data, while also using L1 regularization to control for model complexity.

- use sklearn's StandardScaler to standardize the data before fitting a linear regression model to the data with L1 (Lasso) regularization.
