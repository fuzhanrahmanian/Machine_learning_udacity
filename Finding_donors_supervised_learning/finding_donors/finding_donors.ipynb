    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",
    " - Convert the target label `'income_raw'` to numerical entries.\n",

    "## Evaluating Model Performance\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "#### 1. Ensemble Method (GradientBoosting)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: One of the usage is in the area of learning to rank (Yahoo's commercial web search engines is used this method); Another that can be used in real world is in recognizing the patterns of mobility such as mode of transport in a city. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: several advantages can be described for this method including, flexibility since it can be used for both regression and classification, it is accurate for feature extraction. Additional, it is a useful method for handling various types of predictor variables and accomodating missing data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weekness: One of the main disadvantages is the long training computation time since a lot of hyperparameters need to be tuned including regulatisation parameters and the learning rate otherwise it has a high tendency for overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- candidacy: Since it can find the most important feature and produce accurate results, it is a good candidate for this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Support Vector MAchines (SVM)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: In different application such as image classification and hand writing recognition can be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: It is a versatile method because of the custom kernels. The advantage of maximum margin classifier, memory efficiency, dealing with complex domain where there is clear degree of seperation are the other factors. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weekness: it can not work well when we have a noisy dataset with overlapping classes. It is not efficient for the large dataset since the size of dataset is cubic in the training section. It is very crucial to use the best kernel and regularisation term otherwise overfitting cannnot be avoided.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- candidacy: Since the size of our dataset is not large and we want to predict a category (classificaiton ), this method can be a good candidate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Logistic Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "- Application: Is has several applications in the medical and social sciences. For instance, it can be used to predict the risk of developing a given disease (e.g. diabetes), based on observed characteristics of the patient (age, sex, body mass index, results of various blood tests, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strength: The computation time is fast since it has a numerical solution. It is an useful method for predicting the probability of given independent attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Weekness: It is sensitive to outliers and the chance of overfitting is high. \n",
    "\n",
    "- candidacy: Because of the binary outputs, this method can be counted as a good candidate. \n",

    "\n",
    "The GradientBoosting(GB) is the final chosen model. At the beginning, I need to explain about two terms; Decision Trees and Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Trees: this is a decision support tool. This model uses tree to describe the structure of decisions and their possible consequences. Each node in the tree will act as a query and each branch would be the outcome of this query. The class label that we want to predict, can be represented by each leaf.  Firstly, the type of the answer should correct and incorrect. Secondly, the strategy of asking questions is in following; at the beginning, the set of a broad questions should be used in order to avoid the multiple outcomes, however, at the end, in order to have the correct outcome, some sprecific questions should be asked. At the end, we would face with a tree, which describes all decisions with all of their possible outcomes and we can use this for further prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Boosting: In an example this means exploit the strength of my friends with different skills (weak learner) such as sport, math, science, literature and etc anmd at the end combine all of them (strong learner). Scientifically, this means to bundle up multiple classifiers and make a final model which works accurately in predicting across all areas of the dataset in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GradientBoosting: at the beginning, it pickes a small and weak decision tree. Then, it will check the number of missclassified outcomes and try to improve it in the next steps. Therefore, it will create an another tree by the previous tree and will change some parameters in order to improve and correct the errors that raised in the previous step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will continue to iterate and test till it does not gain any more improvement by adding in new trees and get a minimized loss function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, it will end with a single tree which is composed of small weak decision trees. In order to make a prediciton, each variable will run through all decision tree that has been created. Finally, we can get an expected classification, by a weighted average across those trees.  \n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
